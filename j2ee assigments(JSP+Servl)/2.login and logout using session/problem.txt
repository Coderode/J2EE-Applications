Write a J2EE application for login process. The login interface takes username and password from the user, and on its submission a servlet is invoked. The servlet validates the username and password and display a welcome/error message accordingly. Assume that the correct username and password is hard-coded within the program. Further, on the successful login, the servlet should drop login information as cookie in the client's browser so that it can be automatically read upon the next login. Make necessary assumption, if any.
