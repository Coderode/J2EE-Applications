Question : Write a complete JSP program for student examination processing. Assure that entire student examination data is stored in some database tables. Give option to enter students marks in different papers (only admin can do it), generate result report (student can access it without login). Any update to the examination system must be carried out by the Admin who need valid username and password. Make necessary assumption, if required.

Assumptions:
	-there exist only two admins in admin table who controls for editing
	-username & password will for their account will be provided to them manually don't need registration for them here
	1.username: admin001 password : adminpass
	2.username: admin002 password : adminpass


Directory Structure:
MainDir/
	WEB-INF/lib/mysql-connector-java-8.0.19
	index.jsp
	otherfiles.jsp

Database used : MySQL
database : j2ee_jsp_assignment3
tables:
1.admin (id,name,username,password)
2.student (id,name,email,phone,address)
3.marks(id,paper1,paper2,paper3,paper4,paper5)



for database connection changes go to : connection.jsp

***I have included exported file as j2ee_jsp_assignment3.sql of the database
